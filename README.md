# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a prework study guide created for bootcamp students to prepare them for the course. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JS. I created this to develop a better understand of the fundamentals to be able to hit the ground running when the course begins. This website taught me the basics of the steps required to create a small webiste along with all of the git documentation required to publish it.
